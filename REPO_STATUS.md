## Summary

The repository is a JavaScript/TypeScript library for a documentation browser application. It has a solid structure but lacks testing and continuous integration, which are critical for maintaining code quality. The code is mostly well-organized, but some files are incomplete, and there are areas where documentation could be improved.

## Stuck Areas

- Testing is completely absent, which might hinder identifying bugs and regressions.
- Continuous integration is not set up, which could slow down the development process.

## Next Steps

1. Implement a testing framework and write unit tests for critical components.
2. Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.
3. Complete the implementation of partially written components like `ThemeSwitcher.tsx` and icon components.
4. Enhance documentation, especially for the API and components.
5. Add or improve test coverage

## Issues Found

| ⚪ | Unknown | Some dependencies, such as 'highlight.js', might n |

## TODOs/FIXMEs

No TODO or FIXME comments found.

## Recommendations

1. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests to improve code reliability.
2. Implement continuous integration to streamline the development workflow.
3. Complete the implementation of all components and ensure they are fully documented.
4. Regularly update documentation to reflect changes in the codebase.
5. Review and refactor code to address any anti-patterns and improve maintainability.
