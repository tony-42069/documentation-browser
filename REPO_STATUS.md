## Summary

The repository is a JavaScript/TypeScript library focused on a documentation browser application. It has a well-organized structure with a focus on React components. However, it lacks automated testing and continuous integration, which are crucial for maintaining code quality and reliability. The documentation is present but could be more comprehensive, especially in explaining the purpose and usage of the library.

## Stuck Areas

- Lack of automated testing
- Incomplete component implementations

## Next Steps

1. Implement automated tests for all components and services.
2. Complete the implementation of components like ThemeSwitcher and icons.
3. Enhance documentation to include detailed usage instructions and API references.
4. Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.
5. Add or improve test coverage

## Issues Found
